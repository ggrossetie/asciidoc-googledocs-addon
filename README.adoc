== Usage

 1. Install extension from {webstore}[Google Workspace Marketplace]
 1. Open a document or create a new one
 1. Under the *Add-ons* menu, click *AsciiDoc Processor > Convert all* to convert the entire document into AsciiDoc.
 1. Copy and paste the AsciiDoc output anywhere you want!

NOTE: To convert a part of your document, select some text and click *AsciiDoc Processor > Convert selection*

== Supported text formats

This Add-on supports the following text formats :

 * Headings
 * Bold, italic, underline, subscript, superscript
 * Tables
 * Code bloc
 * Lists (unordered and ordered)
 
== Development

As a Google Apps add-on, this project is written in JavaScript and HTML. The file `app/Code.gs` contains the JavaScript functions; `app/Dialog.html` is the template for calling the conversion functions and displaying the processed output.

=== Testing unpublished code

To safely test the code in your own Google Apps environment, create a new Google Apps project out of these files -- or your modified versions! -- then create and run test deployments using these simple steps.

. Inside a Google Doc, select *Tools > Script editor...*.

* A new tab will open for a blank project, with a `Code.gs` file already started.

. In the new tab, give your project a name, such as `asciidoc-googledocs-addon-test`, and click "Ok".

. Replace the entire body of `Code.gs` with the contents of `app/Code.gs`, and save.

. In the page menu, select *File > New > HTML file*.

. In the *Create* dialog, enter the filename `Dialog.html`, then "Ok".

. Replace the entire body of `Dialog.html` with the contents of `app/Dialog.html`, and save.

. In the page menu, select *Publish > Test as addon*.

. Under "Installation Config", select "Installed and Enabled".

. Click "Select Doc" and choose a Google Doc from your Drive.

. Under "Execute Saved Test", select the radio button to the left of your new test, then click "Test".

* This will open your document in a new tab; your new test addon will be listed under *Add-ons*!
